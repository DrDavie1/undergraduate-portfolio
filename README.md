### Quarter wave plates and their potential to increase the accuracy of the Foucault determination of the speed of light
(Dated: May 2, 2022)
 
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the Foucault method can be improved with the use of modern equipment and therefore, a respectable value of c can be obtained in an undergraduate laboratory. To demon- strate this: Two iterations of the Foucault method were carried out, one using an almost identical method to Foucault’s in 1850 without a water tube. The second with the addition of a quarter-wave plate. Without the quarter-wave-plate, the best value of c was 1.95 × 108 ± 1 × 107ms−1 and with the quarter wave plate c was found to be 2.56 × 108 ± 5 × 107ms−1.

### Effect of Enclosure Symmetry on Acoustic Resonance
(Dated: April 28, 2023)

The following report covers a range of findings in an attempt to develop a well-rounded understanding of how symmetry of an enclosure effects the location and nature of resonant peaks. Data collected across three cavities, primarily a cuboid box, provides clear cut evidence of how modal degeneracy is broken. Furthermore changes to amplitude and width of peaks are observed and analysed , where a vital component of the analysis was a measurement of the speed of sound using each cavity in which a precise result of 343.4 ± 1.5 ms−1 was obtained.

# Physics Undergraduate Portfolio

This portfolio includes hand selected work that I am particularly proud of (therefore it does not include all the coursework i completed), some work completed during my degree may obtain it's own repository, others will be included within this repository.

### Numerical Analysis Of Free Fall with Fixed and Varying Drag

(Dated: November 28, 2022)

The aim of this project is to accurately model the jump that Felix Baumgartner took from 39045m in 2012,
along with demonstrating the mass and cross sectional area required to break the sound barrier. Modelling the
jump, taking Felix’s mass as 110kg and area as 0.9 correctly predicts
that Felix broke the sound barrier

## Lab Reports
A selection of 'formal' reports based on experiments completed throughout my degree, all reports are listed below with abstracts included.

### Effect of Enclosure Symmetry on Acoustic Resonance
(Dated: April 28, 2023)

The following report covers a range of findings in an attempt to develop a well-rounded understanding of how symmetry of an enclosure effects the location and nature of resonant peaks. Data collected across three cavities, primarily a cuboid box, provides clear cut evidence of how modal degeneracy is broken. Furthermore changes to amplitude and width of peaks are observed and analysed , where a vital component of the analysis was a measurement of the speed of sound using each cavity in which a precise result of 343.4 ± 1.5 ms−1 was obtained.

### Quarter wave plates and their potential to increase the accuracy of the Foucault determination of the speed of light
(Dated: May 2, 2022)
 
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the Foucault method can be improved with the use of modern equipment and therefore, a respectable value of c can be obtained in an undergraduate laboratory. To demon- strate this: Two iterations of the Foucault method were carried out, one using an almost identical method to Foucault’s in 1850 without a water tube. The second with the addition of a quarter-wave plate. Without the quarter-wave-plate, the best value of c was 1.95 × 108 ± 1 × 107ms−1 and with the quarter wave plate c was found to be 2.56 × 108 ± 5 × 107ms−1.

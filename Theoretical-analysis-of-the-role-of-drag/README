---------THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF DRAG---------


    -----PROJECT OVERVIEW----

    Disclaimer: This is a University assignment therefore not all the ideas are my own.
		However, the code is.
	
    The Aims of the assignment where:
	- Understand how air resistance modifies the familiar equations of projectile motion
        - Formulate a physical model and to solve that model
	- Assess the reliability and significance of results
	- Manipulate and present data
	- Design a scheme for collecting numerically generated data efficiently
	- Report the results of numerical simulations

    Libraries Used:

        - sympy
        - matplotlib
        - numpy


    Skills shown: Data analysis, Data presentation, Mathematical Functions and Data manipulation. 

    -----Running Information----

    Simply run the jupyter notebook from start to finish.
